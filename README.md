# Educational Institution Database
In this project, I have utilised the complex concepts of OOPs to demonstrate a live version of an Educational Institute Database. This project is entirely rooted in Object Oriented Programming using concepts like Multiple, Multilevel, Hierarchical, Hybrid Inheritance in the code above.

The structure of the inheritance tree is given below.

All the classes and functions are defined and created in such a way that it may be able to store the database and retrieve individual information as and when required.
